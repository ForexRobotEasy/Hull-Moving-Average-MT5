# Hull Moving Average MT5

This code is a custom implementation of the Hull Moving Average (HMA) indicator for MetaTrader 5. The HMA is a popular trend-following indicator that aims to reduce lag and provide more accurate signals compared to traditional moving averages.

## Functionality

The code consists of several custom functions that are used to calculate and utilize the HMA indicator:

1. `HullMovingAverage`: This function calculates the HMA using a weighted moving average of two weighted moving averages. It takes the price data and the length of the HMA as input and returns the calculated HMA value.

2. `WeightedMovingAverage`: This function calculates the weighted moving average of a given price array. It takes the price data and the length of the moving average as input and returns the calculated weighted moving average value.

3. `CutThroughMarketNoise`: This function calculates the smoothed price by averaging the prices over a specified length. It aims to reduce market noise and provide a clearer picture of the underlying trend.

4. `IdentifyTrendReversal`: This function compares the current price with the previous price to identify trend reversals. It returns true if a trend reversal is detected and false otherwise.

5. `IdentifyProfitableOpportunity`: This function compares the current price with the previous price to identify profitable trading opportunities. It returns true if a profitable opportunity is detected and false otherwise.

The code also includes initialization, tick, and deinitialization functions:

1. `OnInit`: This function is called during initialization and is used to initialize the HMA indicator. It calculates the HMA value using the `HullMovingAverage` function and prints it to the terminal.

2. `OnTick`: This function is called on each tick and is used to update the HMA value. It calculates the updated HMA value using the `HullMovingAverage` function and prints it to the terminal.

3. `OnDeinit`: This function is called during deinitialization and is used to perform necessary cleanup tasks.
